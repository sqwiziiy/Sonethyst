# Third-party notices — `decent/`

The three modules in this directory are vendored from **decent-player**
(https://github.com/Ma145/decent-player) and are used under the MIT License.
Build settings were realigned to Sonethyst's toolchain and a control-interface fix
was applied to the USB driver, but the implementation is otherwise unchanged.

## Bundled libFLAC (xiph/flac)

`decent-media3-decoder-flac/src/main/jni/libflac/` is the upstream
[xiph/flac](https://github.com/xiph/flac) source, distributed under its
original BSD-style license — see the headers of those files for the full
notice. The Java/JNI glue in that module derives from
[androidx/media](https://github.com/androidx/media) (Apache-2.0).

decent-player's AGPL-3.0 proof-of-concept harness (the Felicity fork) is **not**
included here — only the MIT-licensed libraries.
